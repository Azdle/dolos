# Dolos
Dolos is a UDP proxy and fuzzing tool. This repository currently contains a
proof of concept that only performs the proxying without any fuzzing. The end
goal is to provide a plugin based system for custom fuzzing, proxying, and
display.

Dolos is written in Rust, to build and run it just run 'cargo run'.
